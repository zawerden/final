    Creates a Streamlit web application for making predictions with a simple regression model.

    This function sets up a Streamlit app with a user interface for inputting a single feature 
    value and making predictions using a pre-trained regression model. The app includes:
    
    - A title displayed at the top of the app.
    - A slider for the user to select an input feature value within a specified range (-3.0 to 3.0).
    - A "Predict value" button that, when clicked, triggers the prediction process.
    - Upon clicking the "Predict value" button, the function:
        - Calls `load_and_predict`, passing the selected feature as input, to load the regression model 
          and make a prediction.
        - Displays the prediction result on the app.
        - Calls `visualize_difference`, passing the input feature and the prediction result,

    Note: This function does not return any value. It directly manipulates the Streamlit app's UI by

    This function takes an array-like object `X` and a float `k`, and returns the index of the

    the absolute difference between each element in `X` and `k`, identifies the minimum value 
    among these differences, and returns the index of this minimum difference.
